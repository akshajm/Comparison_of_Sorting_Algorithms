# Comparison of sorting algorithms

I have created a basic website to show the time complexity of various graphs with respect to input size. For the front-end development, I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript while for backend development, I have used Python and Flask. This website has forms for comparison between 2 algorithms or between all algorithms. Example of forms:

![First form](form1.PNG "All sorting algorithms")
 
 the output will be
 
 
 ![Comparison of all algorithms for input size 5000 numbers](all_plot_5000.png "Comparison of all algorithms for input size 5000")
 
 
The second form consists of comparison between two sorting types. The form also provides an input for the length of array. 
![Second form](form2.PNG "Comparison of 2 algorithms")

 the output will be
 
 
 ![Comparison of 2 algorithms ](Merge_quick.png "Comparison of 2 algorithms")
